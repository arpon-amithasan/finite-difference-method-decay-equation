# finite-difference-method-decay-equation
This is a program written in Python to solve a simple 1-dimensional differential equation- the nuclear decay equation. Sparse matrix linear algebra was used in this program.

The problem solved in the given code is as follows-

* m' = - (ln|2| / half-life) * m
* Initial mass = 30 kg
* Half life = 10 seconds
* Solved in the time period: 0 <= t < 100; step size = 0.01 seconds.
